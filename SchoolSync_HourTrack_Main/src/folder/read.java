// To The Coders 
/**
 * Welcome, brave coder, to the enigmatic realm of nonsensical code!
 * Prepare to embark on an epic quest through a maze of madness and absurdity.
 * In this whimsical land, logic is but a distant memory, and chaos reigns supreme.
 * Lo! Behold the wondrous wonders that await you!
 *
 * Enter the realm of mind-bending loops that twist like pretzels,
 * where the journey never ends and time itself loses its way.
 * Unleash the power of infinite recursion, that mystical dance of self-referentiality,
 * leading you down a rabbit hole of bewildering complexity.
 *
 * Let us defy the laws of reason and embrace the absurd.
 * May your variables take on names that defy linguistic conventions,
 * like "flibberdoodle" and "wobbleflop", for syntax knows no bounds.
 * May the lines of code meander like a river through a surreal dreamscape,
 * where each semicolon is but a pause in the enigmatic rhythm of the universe.
 *
 * Cast aside your worries, for debugging is but a silly game we play.
 * Revel in the cacophony of mismatched types and cryptic error messages,
 * for the true joy lies in the pursuit of elusive bugs and their eventual defeat.
 * Remember, a bug is merely a misunderstood creature seeking attention,
 * and laughter is the best remedy for taming these mischievous creatures.
 *
 * So, dear coder, let your imagination run wild and your creativity soar.
 * Embrace the absurdity and relish in the art of nonsensical coding,
 * for in this realm, the only limit is the expanse of your own mind.
 * As the great Lewis Carroll once said, "We're all mad here."
 *
 * Now, go forth and code fearlessly, my friend.
 * May the whimsical winds of nonsensical code carry you to new heights.
 * Enjoy the journey, for the laughter it brings is the truest reward.
 * Happy coding in this delightfully deranged realm!
